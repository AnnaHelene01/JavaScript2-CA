# JavaScript 2 - Course Assignment
Using Noroffs Social Endpoint API : ("https://noroff-api-docs.netlify.app/")
First time using CSS Framework (Bootstrap)

## Task
The task was to produce a new JavaScript front-end client for an existing social media platform (created in CSS Framwork CA). The client application must be attractive and responsive.
Using the provided API and API documentation, create a functioning user interface that allows for viewing, posting, editing and deleting social media content.
Social API routes require authorisation via JWT (JSON Web Tokens). You will need to register an account and login to access your token.
(with @noroff.no or @stud.noroff.no as your email)
To complete the required features, you will also need to make use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.
Using localStorage were highly recommended, especially for storing JWT tokens.

The following user stories were required for a passing submission:

User with @noroff.no or @stud.noroff.no email can register profile
